Herstory
========

Herstory is a JavaScript History Manager. It provides what is
essentially a "fragment change" event. This allows building JavaScript
applications that can set href's with fragments to maintain state and
provide functional back/forward buttons. Look at examples.html_ for how
to use the library.
